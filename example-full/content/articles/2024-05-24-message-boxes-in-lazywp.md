# Message boxes in lazywp

I pushed my current state into the main branch of [lazywp](https://github.com/lauratheq/lazywp/). It doesn’t seem like much but I can now trigger a message box with a simple command and have an option to answer yes and no questions.

It’s not much, but I am a step closer to more implementations. Currently it’s possible to toggle activation, updating and deleting plugins. The next step is to create an installation prompt for new plugins. I think after that I will implement the help page which dynamically fetches the information from the commands.
