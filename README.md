# Lauras Simple Template Engine

LSTE (Laura's Simple Template Engine) is a minimalist static site generator designed to help you quickly create and manage small websites with ease. LSTE allows you to build a complete website by combining template parts, assets, and content, all while keeping the process straightforward and lightweight.

* See `/example-simple` for a simple website template
* See `/example-full` for a website template which uses several plugins (which basically is my [blog](https://working-directory.com))

## Usage

**Make sure you have python3 and python3-markdown installed.**

1. Clone this repository
2. execute `./lste.py --path=./example-simple` to generate a website into `./example-simple/dist`

```bash
# NAME
#   Lauras Simple Template Enginge - LSTE
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   ./lste.py [--watch] [--path]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   This script generates a website to ./dist out of the given template
#   parts, the assets and the content itself
#
# EXAMPLE:
#   ./lste.py --path=./website-src
#
# OPTIONS
#   -p|--path         Sets the base directory for the website. If not setted
#                     LSTE uses the current active directory
#   -w|--watch        Automatically generates the website to ./dist
#                     if a file in /src, /assets or /parts changed
```

Hint: You can also link the lste.py to your local bin directory to use it systemwide

## Template Development

This guide should help to setup a simple LSTE project:

1. Create a file `lste.conf` in an empty folder and fill it with some settings (see next chapter)
2. Create the folders `./template`, `./content` and `./assets`
3. Place the actual content in `./content`, like `index.md` or `about.md`. LSTE will generate `index.html` or `about.html` out of these files.
4. Use the `./assets` folder for you stylesheets, images etc.
5. Insert your template parts in the `./template` folder

### Site Data

The basic site data is stored in the `lste.conf`. It must have following content:

```bash
[lste]
title = My LSTE Project
keywords = these, are, my, keywords
description = My very first LSTE project
```

These settings are the global settings and data of the project.

### Template Parts

The template parts are simple HTML-files. LSTE needs two mandatory template files:

* `index.html`
* `page.html`

The code snippet `{{part: my-template-part.html}}` allocates `my-template-part.html` in the `./template` folder and includes its content. See `example-simple` for an example.

### Assets

LSTE has no further configuration for the assets folder. It simply copies all its content to the destination so you can use anything in there you want.

### Other functions

There are built-in functions which display different kind of information

* `{{title}}`: Renders the title
* `{{keywords}}`: Renders the meta keywords
* `{{meta-description}}`: Renders the meta description
* `{{timestamp}}`: Renders a unix timestamp when the page was generated by LSTE

## The `--watch` argument

You can start LSTE with the argument `--watch` (or `-w`). It automatically checks for modifications in the folders `./template`, `./content`, `./assets` and the `lste.conf` file. If anything changes there or a file is added, the website will be generated automatically.

```bash
./lste.py --path=./example --watch
```

Starts the watcher for the `./example` project.

## Plugins

LSTE itself is very limited in its functionality but it comes with a plugin system which allows expanding everything in LSTE.

### Currated Plugins

Currently there are following currated plugins available:

* [Meta](https://github.com/lauratheq/meta.lste) allows the usage of meta fields throught an LSTE project
* [Active Menu](https://github.com/lauratheq/active-menu.lste) which allows to indicate which menu entry should be active
* [Articles](https://github.com/lauratheq/articles.lste) enables a blog like content management
* [Excerpts Markdown](https://github.com/lauratheq/excerpts-markdown.lste) enables markdown rendering for excerpts
* [RSS](https://github.com/lauratheq/rss.lste) generates an RSS-Feed out of the articles.

See the readmes on the plugins for more information about their functionality.

### Using plugins

Using plugins in LSTE is fairly easy:

1. Create a file in your home directory called `.listerc`
2. Place the content for the plugins into it whereas the value is the shortened address of the plugin on github:

```
[plugins]
active-menu = lauratheq/active-menu.lste
meta = lauratheq/meta.lste
articles = lauratheq/articles.lste
excerpts-markdown = lauratheq/excerpts-markdown.lste
rss = lauratheq/rss.lste
```

And that's it. LSTE will download the plugins with the next page generation.
